          <h5 class="card-title">Corona Updates</h5>
          <p class="card-text">Coronaviruses are a group of RNA viruses that cause diseases in mammals and birds. In humans and birds, they cause respiratory tract infections that can range from mild to lethal. Mild illnesses in humans include some cases of the common cold (which is also caused by other viruses, predominantly rhinoviruses), while more lethal varieties can cause SARS, MERS, and COVID-19. In cows and pigs they cause diarrhea, while in mice they cause hepatitis and encephalomyelitis. There are as yet no vaccines or antiviral drugs to prevent or treat human coronavirus infections.</p>

            <h5 class="card-title">The maid</h5>
            <p class="card-text"></p>Kalima Mujawar, 29, washes dishes and cleans floors in four homes in Worli, close to the headquarters of several banks and financial institutions today but one of the villages devastated by the plague a century ago. Only one household continued to pay her after the lockdown prevented her from going to work.

            “Even after the lockdown lifts it doesn’t seem like people will want maids to visit their houses for the rest of the year,” she says.
            
            Mujawar is one of millions of people who lost their jobs in recent months, threatening to widen what was already a vast disparity between lifestyles in the city. Mumbaikar Mukesh Ambani, Asia’s richest man, has negotiated billions of dollars in investment despite the lockdown, holding Zoom calls to haggle out details. Yet, families like the Mujawars typically access the internet only through screens of the cheapest China-built phones.</div>

            <h5 class="card-title">The Food Delivery Guy</h5>
            <p class="card-text">Nitin Sawant, 32, is one of Mumbai’s dabbawallas, the city’s renowned lunch-box service. They’ve delivered homecooked meals to officegoers since 1890, and are so famous for reliability that Harvard professors have sought to understand their mastery of logistics.

              Now most of the 5,000-strong force has returned to their villages, says Sawant, who is also secretary at the Mumbai Dabbawala Association. His colleagues have decided they won’t work till Diwali — India’s main holiday that takes place in November this year — because their business involves contact with dozens of people, increasing the risk of contagion to themselves and others.
              
              “People of this city never sat at home even after bomb blasts, riots, floods,” says Sawant. “Now they will be scared. Many may not resume the tiffin service fearing risk of infection.”</p>

            <h5 class="card-title">The Actor</h5>
            <p class="card-text">Alistar Bennis, 24, a theater and screen actor, is also scouting for alternate opportunities.

              Bollywood — as Mumbai’s film industry is called — came to a virtual standstill and though authorities have allowed some work to resume with strict restrictions, producers are moving film-shoots to less infected parts of the country. But Bennis tries to stay optimistic.
              
              “The spirit of Mumbai seems very dead if you wander the streets at night,” he says. “People in business are frowning, shops are closing, but if you take a step and talk to people, they will say: ‘I know a guy, who knows a guy, who will get your job done.’”- Bloomberg</p>
