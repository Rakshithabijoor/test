There is currently no guidance on the use of micronutrient supplements as a treatment of COVID-19.

Current data shows that this drug does not reduce deaths among hospitalised COVID-19 patients, nor help people with moderate disease.*

                The use of hydoxychloroquine and chloroquine is accepted as generally safe for patients with malaria and autoimmune diseases, but its use where not indicated and without medical supervision can cause serious side effects and should be avoided.</p>
